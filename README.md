# Calculator
In this project I will learn how to build a very simple React application.
The project has been split into multiple milestones, and each milestone has functional and technical requirements that need to be implemented.


## Built With
* HTML and JSX
* React
* CSS
* ES6

## Getting Started:

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

1. Under the repository name, click the Clone or download green button.

2. Copy the URL given by clicking the clipboard button.


3. Open a terminal window in your local machine and change the current directory to the one you
   want the clone directory to be made.

4. Type  git clone and then paste the URL you previously copied to the clipboard.

5. Open a new terminal window in your local machine and change the current directory to your
   cloned directory.

6. Run `npm install` / `npm i` from the Terminal.

7. after that `npm run build` from the terminal.

8. Finally `npm start`.
